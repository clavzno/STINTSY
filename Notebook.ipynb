        "For this project, we were assigned two real-world datasets. We selected the **Labor Force Survey (LFS)** from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The dataset contains a nationwide survey conducted in April 2016. It **aimed to estimate employment and unemployment levels and view the trends** in the country as whole and for each of the 17 administrative regions, which can then be used to provide a framework for labor market policies and plans. These kinds of data are important for economic analysis, policy formation, and planning at the regional and national level of country. The survey **collected data on demographic characteristics** (`household membership`, `relationship to head of the household`, `sex`, `age`, `marital status`, `education`, etc.) **and economic characteristics** (`employment status`, `industry group`, `class of worker`, `previous job`, `hours worked`, etc.)\n",

The data was collected from April 8, 2016 to April 30, 2016, and used the **2013 Master Sample Design** for household-based surveys. A master sample consists of randomly assigned and selected geographic areas with non-overlapping boundaries, known as primary sampling units (PSUs). PSUs contain 100-400 households. The mode of data collection is through face-to-face interviews.\n",
